 > The writing of this textbook was a mammoth task for which a lot of help was required from many 
people. Fortunately, I have had the fine support of my family, friends, and fellow members of the 
teaching staff at the Institute of Information Technology and Management (IITM). My special 
thanks would always go to my father Mr Janak Raj Thareja and mother Mrs Usha Thareja, my 
brother Pallav and sisters Kimi and Rashi who were a source of abiding inspiration and divine 
blessings for me. I am especially thankful to my son Goransh who has been very patient and 
cooperative in letting me realize my dreams. My sincere thanks go to my uncle Mr B.L. Thareja 
for his inspiration and guidance in writing this book.
 

 >  I would also like to thank my students and colleagues at IITM who had always been there to 
extend help while designing and testing the algorithms. Finally, I would like to thank the editorial 
team at Oxford University Press for their help and support.
 

 >  Comments and suggestions for the improvement of the book are welcome. Please send them
