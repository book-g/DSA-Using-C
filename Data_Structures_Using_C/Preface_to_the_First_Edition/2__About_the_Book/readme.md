 > This book is aimed at serving as a textbook for undergraduate engineering students of computer 
science and postgraduate level courses of computer applications. The objective of this book is to 
introduce the concepts of data structures and apply these concepts in problem solving. The book 
provides a thorough and comprehensive coverage of the fundamentals of data structures and the 
principles of algorithm analysis. The main focus has been to explain the principles required to 
select or design the data structure that will best solve the problem.
 

 >  A structured approach is followed to explain the process of problem solving. A theoretical 
description of the problem is followed by the underlying technique. These are then ably supported 
by an example followed by an algorithm, and finally the corresponding program in C language.
 

 >  The salient features of the book include: 


 - Explanation of the concepts using diagrams 

 - Numerous solved examples within the chapters 

 - Glossary of important terms at the end of each chapter 

 - Comprehensive exercises at the end of each chapter 

 - Practical implementation of the algorithms using tested C programs 

 - Objective type questions to enhance the analytical ability of the students 

 - Annexures to provide supplementary information to help generate further interest in the subject 

 > The book is also useful as a reference and resource to young researchers working on efficient 
data storage and related applications, who will find it to be a helpful guide to the newly established 
techniques of a rapidly growing research field.
