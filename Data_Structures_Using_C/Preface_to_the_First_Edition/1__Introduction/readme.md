## 1. Introduction 


 > A data structure is defined as a group of data elements used for organizing and storing data. In order 
to be effective, data has to be organized in a manner that adds to the efficiency of an algorithm, and 
data structures such as stacks, queues, linked lists, heaps, and trees provide different capabilities 
to organize data.
 

 > While developing a program or an application, many developers find themselves more interested 
in the type of algorithm used rather than the type of data structure implemented. However, the 
choice of data structure used for a particular algorithm is always of the utmost importance. Each 
data structure has its own unique properties and is constructed to suit various kinds of applications. 
Some of them are highly specialized to carry out specific tasks. For example, B-trees with their 
unique ability to organize indexes are well-suited for the implementation of databases. Similarly, 
stack, a linear data structure which provides ‘last-in-first-out’ access, is used to store and track 
the sequence of web pages while we browse the Internet. Specific data structures are essential 
components of many efficient algorithms, and make possible the management of large amounts of 
data, such as large databases and Internet indexing services. C, as we all know, is the most popular 
programming language and is widespread among all the computer architectures. Therefore, it is 
not only logical but also fundamentally essential to start the introduction and implementation of 
various data structures through C. The course data structures is typically taught in the second or 
third semester of most engineering colleges and across most engineering disciplines in India. The 
aim of this course is to help students master the design and applications of various data structures 
and use them in writing effective programs.
