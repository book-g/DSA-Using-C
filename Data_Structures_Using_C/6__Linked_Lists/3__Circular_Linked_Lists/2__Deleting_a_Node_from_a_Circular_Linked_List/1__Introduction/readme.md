## 1. Introduction 


 > In this section, we will discuss how a node is deleted from an already existing circular linked list.
We will take two cases and then see how deletion is done in each case. Rest of the cases of 
deletion are same as that given for singly linked
lists.
 


 - Case 1: The first node is deleted 

 - Case 2: The last node is deleted.
