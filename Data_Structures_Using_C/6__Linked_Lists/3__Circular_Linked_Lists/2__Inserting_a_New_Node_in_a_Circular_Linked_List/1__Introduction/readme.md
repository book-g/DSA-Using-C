## 1. Introduction 


 > In this section, we will see how a new node is added into an already existing linked list. We will
take two cases and then see how insertion is done in each case. 


 - Case 1: The new node is inserted at the beginning of the circular linked list.
 

 - Case 2: The new node is inserted at the end of the circular linked list.
