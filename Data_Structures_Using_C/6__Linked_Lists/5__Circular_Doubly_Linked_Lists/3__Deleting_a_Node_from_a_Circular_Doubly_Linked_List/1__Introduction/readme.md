## 1. Introduction 


 >  In this section, we will see how a node is deleted from an already existing circular doubly linked 
list. We will take two cases and then see how deletion is done in each case. Rest of the cases are 
same as that given for doubly linked lists.
 


 - Case 1: The first node is deleted. 

 - Case 2: The last node is deleted.
