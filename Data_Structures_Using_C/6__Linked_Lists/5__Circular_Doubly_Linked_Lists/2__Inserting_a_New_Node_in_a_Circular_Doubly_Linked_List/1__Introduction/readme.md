## 1. Introduction 


 > In this section, we will see how a new node is added into an already existing circular doubly linked 
list. We will take two cases and then see how insertion is done in each case. Rest of the cases are 
similar to that given for doubly linked lists.
 


 - Case 1: The new node is inserted at the beginning. 

 - Case 2: The new node is inserted at the end.
