## 7. Multi-linked Lints 


 >  In a multi-linked list, each node can have n number of pointers to other nodes. A doubly linked 
list is a special case of multi-linked lists. However, unlike doubly linked lists, nodes in a multi
linked list may or may not have inverses for each pointer. We can differentiate a doubly linked 
list from a multi-linked list in two ways: 


 -  (a) A doubly linked list has exactly two pointers. One pointer points to the previous node and 
the other points to the next node. But a node in the multi-linked list can have any number of 
pointers. 

 -  (b) In a doubly linked list, pointers are exact inverses of each other, i.e., for every pointer which 
points to a previous node there is a pointer which points to the next node. This is not true for 
a multi-linked list. 

 >  Multi-linked lists are generally used to organize multiple orders of one set of elements. For 
example, if we have a linked list that stores name and marks obtained by students in a class, then 
we can organize the nodes of the list in two ways: 


 -  (i) Organize the nodes alphabetically (according to the name) 

 -  (ii) Organize the nodes according to decreasing order of marks so that the information of student 
 

 > who got highest marks comes before other students.
 Figure 6.71 shows a multi-linked list in which studentsâ€™ nodes are organized by both the 
aforementioned ways.

 >  A new node can be inserted in a multi-linked list in the same way as it is done for a doubly 
linked list.  

 > note In multi-linked lists, we can have inverses of each pointer as in a doubly linked list. But for that we 
must have four pointers in a single node.

 >  Multi-linked lists are also used to store sparse matrices. In Chapter 3 we have 
read about sparse matrices. Such matrices have very few non-zero values stored 
and most of the entries are zero. Sparse matrices are very common in engineering 
applications. If we use a normal array to store such matrices, we will end up 
wasting a lot of space. Therefore, a better solution is to represent these matrices 
using multi-linked lists. 

 > The sparse matrix shown in Fig. 6.72 can be represented using a linked list 
for every row and column. Since a value is in exactly one row and one column, 
it will appear in both lists exactly once. A node in the multi-linked will have 
four parts. First stores the data, second stores a pointer to the next node in the 
row, third stores a pointer to the next node in the column, and the fourth stores 
the coordinates or the row and column number in which the data appears in  the matrix. However, as in case of doubly linked lists, we can also have a corresponding inverse 
pointer for every pointer in the multi-linked list representation of a sparse matrix.
 

 > note When a non-zero value in the sparse matrix is set to zero, the corresponding node in the multi-linked 
list must be deleted.
