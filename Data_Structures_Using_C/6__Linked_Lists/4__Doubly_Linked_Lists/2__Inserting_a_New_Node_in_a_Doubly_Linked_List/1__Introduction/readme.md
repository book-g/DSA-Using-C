## 1. Introduction 


 >  In this section, we will discuss how a new node is added into an 
already existing doubly linked list. We will take four cases and 
then see how insertion is done in each case. 


 - Case 1: The new node is inserted at the beginning. 

 - Case 2: The new node is inserted at the end. 

 - Case 3: The new node is inserted after a given node. 

 - Case 4: The new node is inserted before a given node.
