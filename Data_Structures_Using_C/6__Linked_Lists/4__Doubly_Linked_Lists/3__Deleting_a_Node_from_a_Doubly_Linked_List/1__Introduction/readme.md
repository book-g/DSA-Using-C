## 1. Introduction 


 >  In this section, we will see how a node is deleted from an already existing doubly linked list. We 
will take four cases and then see how deletion is done in each case.
 


 - Case 1: The first node is deleted. 

 - Case 2: The last node is deleted. 

 - Case 3: The node after a given node is deleted. 

 - Case 4: The node before a given node is deleted.
