 >  A singly linked list is the simplest type of linked list in which every node contains some data and 
a pointer to the next node of the same data type. By saying that the node contains a pointer to the 
next node, we mean that the node stores the address of the next node in sequence. A singly linked 
list allows traversal of data only in one way. Figure 6.7 shows a singly linked list.
