 - Case 1: The new node is inserted at the beginning. 

 - Case 2: The new node is inserted at the end. 

 - Case 3: The new node is inserted after a given node. 

 -  Case 4: The new node is inserted before a given node. 

 > Before we describe the algorithms to perform insertions in all these four cases, let us first discuss 
an important term called OVERFLOW. Overflow is a condition that occurs when AVAIL = NULL or no 
free memory cell is present in the system. When this condition occurs, the program must give an 
appropriate message.
