## 2. Polynomial Representation 


 >  Let us see how a polynomial is represented in the memory using a linked list. Consider a polynomial 
$6x^3 + 9x^2 + 7x + 1$ . Every individual term in a polynomial consists of two parts, a coefficient 
and a power. Here, 6, 9, 7, and 1 are the coefficients of the terms that have 3, 2, 1, and 0 as their 
powers respectively.
 

 >  Every term of a polynomial can be represented as a node of the linked list. Figure 6.74 shows 
the linked representation of the terms of the above polynomial.

 > Now that we know how polynomials are represented using nodes of a linked list, let us write a 
program to perform operations on polynomials.
