 >  Both arrays and linked lists are a linear collection of data elements. But unlike an array, a linked 
list does not store its nodes in consecutive memory locations. Another point of difference between 
an array and a linked list is that a linked list does not allow random access of data. Nodes in a 
linked list can be accessed only in a sequential manner. But like an array, insertions and deletions 
can be done at any point in the list in a constant time.
 

 > Another advantage of a linked list over an array is that we can add any number of elements in the 
list. This is not possible in case of an array. For example, if we declare an array as int marks[20], 
then the array can store a maximum of 20 data elements only. There is no such restriction in case 
of a linked list.

 > Thus, linked lists provide an efficient way of storing related data and performing basic operations 
such as insertion, deletion, and updation of information at the cost of extra space required for 
storing the address of next nodes.
