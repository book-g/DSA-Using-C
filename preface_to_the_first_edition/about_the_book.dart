This book is aimed at serving as a textbook for undergraduate engineering students of computer 
science and postgraduate level courses of computer applications. The objective of this book is to 
introduce the concepts of data structures and apply these concepts in problem solving. The book 
provides a thorough and comprehensive coverage of the fundamentals of data structures and the 
principles of algorithm analysis. The main focus has been to explain the principles required to 
select or design the data structure that will best solve the problem.
""";

var p2 = """
 A structured approach is followed to explain the process of problem solving. A theoretical 
description of the problem is followed by the underlying technique. These are then ably supported 
by an example followed by an algorithm, and finally the corresponding program in C language.
